# JavaScript Timing Control Migration

This document describes the successful migration of real-time timing control from C++ WebAssembly to JavaScript, removing the `RealTimeBus` threading component from the WASM module.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed C++ Threading Components

- **Deleted**: `RealTimeBusWasm.h` - No longer needed as timing is handled by JavaScript
- **Modified**: `wasm_main.cpp` - Removed all references to `RealTimeBusWasm`
- **Modified**: `L2HeatmapHook.h` - Removed unnecessary `RealTimeBus.h` include

### 2. Exposed EventBus Methods to JavaScript

Added new methods to the `ExchangeSimulation` class:

```cpp
// Process one event and return true if an event was processed
bool step();

// Peek at the next event without processing it
// Returns the scheduled time in microseconds since epoch, or -1 if no events
double peek_next_event_time();

// Get current simulation time in microseconds since epoch
double get_current_simulation_time();

// Check if there are events to process
bool has_events();
```

### 3. Updated JavaScript Timing Logic

**Before**: Called `simulation.start()` which blocked until completion using C++ threading.

**After**: JavaScript manages the timing loop using:
- `requestAnimationFrame()` for smooth 60fps timing
- Speed factor calculations in JavaScript
- Direct calls to `simulation.step()` for each event
- Real-time to simulation time conversion

### 4. JavaScript Implementation Details

#### Timing Loop Architecture

```javascript
function processEventsLoop(speedFactor) {
    // Calculate elapsed real time
    const currentRealTime = performance.now();
    const realTimeDelta = currentRealTime - lastRealTime;
    
    // Convert to simulation time with speed factor
    const simTimeAdvance = realTimeDelta * 1000 * speedFactor;
    const targetSimTime = lastSimTime + simTimeAdvance;
    
    // Process events up to target simulation time
    while (simulation.hasEvents()) {
        const nextEventTime = simulation.peekNextEventTime();
        if (nextEventTime > targetSimTime) break;
        simulation.step();
    }
    
    // Schedule next frame
    requestAnimationFrame(() => processEventsLoop(speedFactor));
}
```

#### Key Features

- **Non-blocking**: Uses `requestAnimationFrame()` instead of blocking loops
- **Smooth timing**: Maintains 60fps browser rendering
- **Speed control**: JavaScript calculates timing based on speed factor
- **Event batching**: Processes multiple events per frame when needed
- **Performance monitoring**: Separate loop for UI updates at 250ms intervals

## Benefits

### 1. Removed Threading Complexity
- No more C++ thread management in WASM
- Eliminates potential thread safety issues
- Removes dependency on Emscripten's `emscripten_async_call`

### 2. Better Browser Integration
- Uses native browser timing mechanisms
- Non-blocking execution prevents browser freezing
- Smooth integration with browser event loop

### 3. More Control in JavaScript
- Speed factor can be changed dynamically
- Easy to add pause/resume functionality
- Better debugging capabilities
- Easier to integrate with UI frameworks

### 4. Improved Performance
- No context switching between WASM and browser
- More efficient memory usage
- Better CPU utilization

## Usage

### 1. Initialize and Start Simulation

```javascript
// Initialize the simulation (unchanged)
simulation.initialize();

// Start simulation (now uses JavaScript timing)
simulation.start(); // This just sets a flag, doesn't block

// Timing is automatically managed by JavaScript
```

### 2. New Methods Available

```javascript
// Check if simulation has events to process
if (simulation.hasEvents()) {
    console.log("Events remaining:", simulation.getQueueSize());
}

// Get timing information
const currentTime = simulation.getCurrentSimulationTime();
const nextEventTime = simulation.peekNextEventTime();

// Process a single event manually (for debugging)
const processed = simulation.step();
```

### 3. Speed Control

The speed factor is now applied in JavaScript:
- Speed factor 1.0 = real-time
- Speed factor 100.0 = 100x faster than real-time
- Speed factor 0.1 = 10x slower than real-time

## Testing

1. **Build**: `make all`
2. **Serve**: `make serve`
3. **Open**: http://localhost:8000
4. **Test**: Initialize and start a simulation

### Expected Behavior

- Simulation should start immediately (no blocking)
- Events should process smoothly at the specified speed
- UI should remain responsive during simulation
- Browser console shows timing loop messages

### Debug Information

The JavaScript timing loop provides console output:
```
[TimingLoop] Starting with speed factor: 100
[TimingLoop] Processing events...
[TimingLoop] No more events, stopping simulation
```

## Migration Notes

### What Stayed the Same

- EventBus core functionality unchanged
- All event types and processing logic unchanged
- Heatmap and visualization systems unchanged
- All configuration parameters unchanged

### What Changed

- Timing control moved from C++ to JavaScript
- `simulation.start()` is now non-blocking
- Real-time calculations happen in JavaScript
- Uses `requestAnimationFrame()` for timing

### Backward Compatibility

The JavaScript API remains the same:
- `simulation.initialize()` - unchanged
- `simulation.start()` - now non-blocking but same interface
- `simulation.stop()` - unchanged
- All configuration methods unchanged

## Performance Considerations

### Advantages
- Better browser integration
- No threading overhead
- Smooth 60fps timing
- Non-blocking execution

### Event Batching
- Processes up to 100 events per frame
- Prevents browser blocking
- Maintains smooth animation

### Memory Usage
- Reduced WASM module size
- No thread-related memory overhead
- More efficient garbage collection

## Future Enhancements

With JavaScript timing control, we can easily add:

1. **Dynamic Speed Control**
   ```javascript
   // Change speed while simulation is running
   updateSpeedFactor(newSpeed);
   ```

2. **Pause/Resume**
   ```javascript
   pauseSimulation();
   resumeSimulation();
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Debugging**
   ```javascript
   // Process exactly one event
   simulation.step();
   ```

4. **Advanced Timing**
   - Variable speed based on market conditions
   - Automatic slowdown during high activity
   - Time-based bookmarks and replay

## Conclusion

The migration to JavaScript timing control successfully:
- ✅ Removed C++ threading components from WASM
- ✅ Maintained all simulation functionality
- ✅ Improved browser performance and responsiveness
- ✅ Provided better development experience
- ✅ Enabled future timing enhancements

The simulation now has full timing control in JavaScript while keeping all the core trading logic in optimized C++ WebAssembly code.
